CSC 4480 Final Project

Our new streaming platform, NovaStream, allows you to watch your movies, leave reviews, give ratings, and save movies to watch later. The database will hold user information, movie information, reviews, and trend information. Users will be able to create an account with several different profiles. Each profile has a streaming history and the ability to leave a rating on each movie they watch. Each user can also see the trending movies.
